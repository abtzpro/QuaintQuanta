# QuaintQuanta
Quantum Machine Learning (QML) in Python 

This repository contains the QuaintQuanta (QQ.py) Python script demonstrating the application of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) to solve a classification problem using both quantum and classical machine learning methods.

## Features

The QQ.py script uses an advanced version of a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) and a classical Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to classify wine samples based on their chemical properties.

	•	Quantum machine learning with an advanced Quantum Neural Network (QNN)
	•	Classical machine learning with a Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
	•	Use of the Wine dataset from sklearn for multiclass classification
	•	Data preprocessing (scaling) to adjust for the quantum model
	•	Optimization with hyperparameter tuning

## Installation

To run the QQ.py script, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

	•	PennyLane
	•	numpy
	•	sklearn

If not installed, use pip to install them:
```
pip install pennylane numpy sklearn
```
## Usage

To run the script, simply navigate to its directory and run the command:
```
python QQ.py
```

## How the QQ.py Script Works

The script constructs a parameterized quantum circuit (a Quantum Neural Network) using PennyLane, a Python library for quantum machine learning. The quantum model is then trained using a hybrid quantum-classical approach.

The data for the model is obtained from sklearn’s Wine dataset, which is then split into training and testing sets.

The quantum AI model uses the concept of amplitude embedding to encode real-valued data into the state of a quantum system. It then uses the concept of entangling layers and StronglyEntanglingLayers from PennyLane for building up a more complex quantum circuit.

An optimization process is carried out to train the quantum model. The cost function used for training the quantum model is a function of the model’s accuracy on the training data. The optimization aims to minimize this cost function.

A classical SVC model is then trained on the same data, which is transformed by the quantum feature map, and its performance is tested.

Finally, the accuracy of the SVC model on the testing data is printed.

## Future Development Potential

The script offers several opportunities for customization and further development:

	•	The quantum model structure can be modified or extended to create more complex QNNs.
	•	Other quantum feature maps and embeddings can be experimented with.
	•	Different optimization strategies and cost functions can be explored.
	•	You could also experiment with other quantum-compatible datasets, and perform different tasks such as regression or clustering.
	•	Additionally, you could also experiment with quantum computing hardware, using PennyLane’s ability to connect to different quantum computing backends.

## Limitations and Considerations

While the script is a good example of the principles of Quantum Machine Learning, it should be noted that the field is still in its nascent stage and the script is in a research/experimental stage. Quantum Machine Learning is computationally intensive and may not be practical for larger datasets or more complex tasks with the current state of quantum computing technology. However, as quantum technology advances, it is expected to have significant potential for machine learning.

Also, keep in mind that running quantum simulations for large numbers of qubits might require substantial computational resources. This is one of the key challenges in scaling up quantum computations.

In addition, the performance of the model heavily depends on the dataset used and how it is preprocessed, so care should be taken when selecting and preprocessing the data.
